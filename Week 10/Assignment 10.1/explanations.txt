1. The errors that appear after removing "usingnamespace std;":

After removing the "usingnamespace std;" the compailer does not recognize
multiple commands like "string", "cout", "endl". Because they are standard
commands every command needs to have a "std:: " before them, this would solve 
the erros. By using "usingnamespace std;" the comapiler automaticaly puts
"std::" before every standard command.

2. The errors that appear after removing "Critter:: " from the "setName" method:

After removing "Critter:: " from the "setName" method the compailer does not recognize
the method "setName" which comes from the "Critter.h" header file, from the class
Critter. The comapiler does not recognize the method without a mention regarding from
which class the command is.
